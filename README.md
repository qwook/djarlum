djarlum
=======

Djarlum is a shoot-em-up game based on gallaga and gradius.

It is made for the [lowrezjam2014](http://www.deviever.com/lowrezjam2014/),  
in which a game was to be constructed using only 32x32 resolution.

I blew the gameÂ up a few sizes so that you can actually see what you're doing.

The game isn't done yet but you can test out the web version here: http://qwook.github.io/djarlum  
The engine I'm using hasn't been completely ported over to web, so there might be some freezing.
